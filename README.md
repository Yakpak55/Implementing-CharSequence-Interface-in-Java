# Implementing-CharSequence-Interface-in-Java
 Developed a Java program to implement the CharSequence interface, demonstrating the use of interfaces and abstract methods. 
 
 The project involved:

● Class Structure: Created the Code class with private fields codeArray, numRows, and numColumns. Implemented methods to load and print the array.

● Method Overriding: Overridden the charAt, length, and subSequence methods from the CharSequence interface:

 ● charAt: Returned the character corresponding to the ASCII code at the specified index in the array.
 
 ● length: Calculated and returned the total number of characters in the array.
 
 ● subSequence: Returned a string formed by concatenating characters from a specified start to end index.

● User Interaction: Designed a command-line interface in the DriverClass to interact with the user, allowing input of array dimensions and values, and testing the implemented methods.
